# Data-Scientist-Portfolio
## À propos
Hi, I'm Loris! I have a background in chemistry and a solid foundation in data science, including machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I have developed a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my final year at university, driven by curiosity, I began to acquire knowledge in the field of data science through online courses (e.g., Open Classroom) and personal projects. My training encompassed rigorous data analysis using statistics and the tools necessary for implementing these analyses, such as Python and SQL. This multidisciplinary approach allowed me to integrate chemistry and data science effectively, culminating in models capable of predicting the yields of chemical reactions and molecular properties. Some of these projects were carried out in collaboration with my thesis supervisors, based on the scientific publications we co-produced. Additionally, I am currently participating in the "Leash-Bio" challenge on Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new machine learning and deep learning algorithms, data analysis tools, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data and machine learning to solve complex problems.

My CV in pdf.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
